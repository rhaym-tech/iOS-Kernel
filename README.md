    <h1 style="text-align: center;">how to write an iOS kernel exploit</h1>
    <p>In this tutorial, we will discuss how to write an iOS kernel exploit. iOS is a popular mobile operating system that runs on the Apple hardware. It is widely used in devices such as the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. </p>
    <p>An exploit is a type of malicious code that takes advantage of a security vulnerability in the operating system in order to gain access to the computer’s resources. Kernel exploits are used to gain control over a compromised iOS device by loading malicious instructions directly into the memory of the Operating System. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to build an iOS kernel exploit using the Metasploit Framework, a popular tool used by hackers to find vulnerabilities in systems running a variety of operating systems.</p>
    <p>The Metasploit Framework is an all-in-one penetration testing toolkit that allows security researchers to perform assessments on their target systems and leverage existing exploits to gain unauthorized access to the system or data stored on the system. It can be used to create custom exploits for vulnerable applications and tools included in the framework such as Meterpreter, Frida and more.</p>
    <p>We will use the 2017’s version of the framework to demonstrate how to set up and use the various components of Metasploit in order to build a working kernel exploit for the iOS operating system. We will start by creating a new Metasploit instance and running it on an OS X machine. Once the framework is installed, we will select the target device and enter some information about the attack so that we can easily identify the payload that is being executed on the compromised system. We will then select the payload that will be used during the attack based on the functionality that we need to achieve on the targeted device. Finally, we will create a custom kernel exploit that can be used to gain full control over the target device.</p>

    <h3>1) What is Metasploit? </h3>
    <p>Metasploit is a penetration testing tool that is used by security researchers and hackers to identify vulnerabilities in applications and operating systems that can be exploited to gain access to computer systems or steal sensitive data from these systems. It is a cross-platform penetration testing framework that can be used with a number of applications including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
    <p>A penetration test is an assessment conducted by security professionals to evaluate the security of a system or network by identifying potential threats to the system and mitigating these risks. <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/">Penetration testing</a><sup>[1]</sup> (pen testing) commonly uses Metasploit to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications and web servers in order to gain access to confidential data and take control of the web server. </p>
    <h3>2) What are the components of Metasploit? </h3>
    <p>The various modules of Metasploit can be used to perform a number of different tasks including creating buffer overflow attacks, discovering password hashes, performing</p>
